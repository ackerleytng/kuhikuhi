* About

This is a project management tool.

* Concepts

** Updates
Updates are progress updates for a particular task.
An example of an update would be:
"[Date/timestamp] Equipment purchased and is with xyz now."

Only tasks can have updates.
 - (not sure if too restrictive) If you have to add an update to a project, rearrange/add/remove tasks to add an update appropriately

** Status
Status is a series of options with associated levels of completion
This is configurable.
For example
| Status                         | Completion (out of 10) |
|--------------------------------+------------------------|
| Pending manpower availability  |                      0 |
| Pending equipment purchase     |                      1 |
| Pending development completion |                      5 |
| Pending demo                   |                      7 |
| Pending user trial             |                      8 |
| Pending update to boss         |                      9 |
| Complete                       |                     10 |
